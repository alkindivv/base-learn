# Base Learn - Tutorials

Quick reference repo for completing Base Learn exercises and unlocking Base Guild roles.

## What's This For?

If you're still struggling through [Base Learn](https://docs.base.org/learn/welcome) and need help getting the base learners role in Base Guild. I've this repo for the exercise contracts you need to deploy.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have:

- MetaMask or any Web3 wallet
- Some Base Sepolia ETH for gas (get them fro here [Base Sepolia Faucet](https://www.coinbase.com/faucets/base-ethereum-goerli-faucet))

## Ready?

### Step 1: Deploy The Contract

1. Go to [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/)
2. Create a new file in the `contracts` folder
3. Copy the Solidity code from this repo
4. Compile it (click the Solidity icon on the left, then "Compile")
5. Deploy to Base Sepolia:
   - Switch MetaMask to Base Sepolia network
   - Click the Deploy icon
   - Select "Injected Provider - MetaMask"
   - Hit Deploy and confirm the transaction

### Step 2: Submit to Base Learn

1. Go to the corresponding lesson on [Base Learn](https://docs.base.org/learn/welcome)
2. Scroll to the exercise section
3. Paste your deployed contract address
4. Click Submit
5. Wait for verification (usually takes a few seconds)

### Step 3: Claim Your Role

1. Head to [Base Guild](https://era.guild.xyz/base) (they migrated from guild.xyz)
2. Connect your wallet and socials
3. Your base-learners role should unlock automatically
4. If it doesn't show up, try refreshing or reconnecting

## Troubleshooting

**Contract won't deploy?**
- Make sure you're on Base Sepolia network
- Check you have enough testnet ETH for gas
- Try compiling again with the latest compiler version

**If youre submission rejected**
- Double-check you copied the contract address correctly
- Make sure your contract actually deployed (check Base scan)
- Verify you're submitting to the right exercise

**Role not showing up?**
- Reconnect your wallet on Guild
- Make sure you completed the exercise on the same wallet
- Give it a few minutes, sometimes it takes time to sync
